# ACM Research coding challenge (Fall 2022)

This semester's challenge is especially open-ended. [Here is a dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chancev/carsforsale) on Kaggle called "CarsForSale". It contains data scraped from the online car marketplace Cars.com. Each row contains 25 pieces of information about a car's listing, such as its price, year, model, and color.

The challenge is to do *something interesting* with the data. Can you find a pattern, answer a question, or create a visualization? In case nothing comes to mind, here are some ideas, with varying complexity:

- What qualities about a car do buyers seem to value the most?
- Make a graph to visualize the most popular car models over time.
- What colors of cars are most expensive?
- Do different brands try to appeal to people looking for different things?
- Come up with your own algorithm to figure out how good of a deal a listing is and compare it to the one in the dataset (`DealType`).
- Use [cluster analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis) to group the cars into categories.
- How do people's taste in cars differ between states?
- Train a machine learning model to predict some aspect of a car based on other information from its listing.

However, we strongly encourage you to come up with your own problem to solve!

You can use any programming language, framework, or library you want, but we recommend [creating a notebook in Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/docs/notebooks) and using Python. This will run in your browser, interlaces code with documentation, allows you to import the CarsForSale dataset easily by pressing the "Add data" button, and gives you access to Python's high-quality, high-level libraries for working with data.

About The Project
Product Name Screen Shot

There are many great README templates available on GitHub; however, I didn't find one that really suited my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a README template so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need -- I think this is it.

Here's why:

Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
You should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life ðŸ˜„
Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this template!

Use the BLANK_README.md to get started.
